Dr. Kotarathill said the record would best show the specific anesthetic used to prevent future problems.  The Dr. that did the surgery was Metcalf.

            "Text: I had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE with BOTH the NURSE PRACTITIONER and the DOCTOR.  The nurse gave me forms to fill out regarding my health history and then sat and asked me the same questions but in a different order during the time I was trying to fill out the forms. Why the duplication Either ask me to fill out the form or ask the questions. The NP then came in and asked me the same questions again.  Could she not read the answers I had written on the form or the notes the nurse entered into the computer I scheduled an appt with Dr. Bisson not a nurse practitioner.  I see NPs regularly and have a lot of confidence in them my primary care physician is actually a NP however I had specifically scheduled an appt with a neurosurgeon not a NP.  Finally near the end of the exam by the NP I asked if I was going to be able to see the doctor.  The NP acted a little standoffish and said of course you will see the doctor.  How was I to know if I didnt ask   The doctor did not spend much time with me or seem to acknowledge the severe pain I was experiencing even though I was continually squirming and rubbing my back against the wall for relief due to continual spasms in my back and arm.   I had given the nurse a CD with the MRI and a paper copy of the radiologists report.  The NP talked negatively about the MRI because it had been done at another facility and not on the same type of MRI scan as at their facility.  It wasnt that the scan was unreadable but that it didnt include a specific measuring tool.  I had gone to an MRI facility which had been recommended by my chiropractor I had no idea at the time that I would be looking for a neurosurgeon or that the MRI would need to be taken to another facility.     I asked the NP if they had read the radiologist report and was told they read the MRIs themselves and do not look at radiologists reports.  I was shocked this seemed aloof and noncollaborative.  I am fine with the doctor reading the MRI and coming to hisher own conclusion but I would think heshe would want to compare their diagnosis with what a radiologist wrote.  If the conclusions are different it seems logical that they would review the MRI again.   The treatment plan did not seem complete.  I was given a prescription and next steps.  However the next steps were not detailed I was told I could get an injection but not told who to contact or where to go I guess they expected me to call back if the prescription didnt solve the problem.   I was so unimpressed with the care that I went to another facility to talk with a different neurosurgeon 2 days later. The other neurosurgeon seemed genuinely concerned about the pain I was in and asked more probing questions.  He did not complain about the MRI.  He read the radiologists report.  I was given a very different treatment plan.   I will not be contacting Dr. Bisson again and I do not want to see the NP again.   Although the new facility in Daybreak is very nice my experience with the NP and doctor were so negative that I  do not plan to return.\n",

She was professional and very thorough.  She had a genuine sense of concern.   I liked how she thought of all of my medical problems wholistically rather than just focusing on the few symptoms I was presenting that day.  I particularly liked how she considered the fact that I was pregnant.  She then consulted with Doc Ragle.  They came in together with a great list of solutions that allowed me to manage my asthma and sinus issues which were likely a contributor of my current symptoms cold respiratory infection.  Most of the medical advice I had received about my regular inhalers and  nasal spray was to avoid them as much as possible while pregnant.  Dr Ragel and his student came up with alternate meds to help manage the underlying problem.  Awesome.  A set of class B drugs is a far better solution than none at all.  Already after only being on the meds for 23 days I can already feel relief in both my asthma symptoms and my sinus congestion.\n",

VERY disappointing since I had expected a physical exam to establish where I still have pain since my May 9 surgical procedure cervical nerve block injection did not seem to help and possibly other testing recommendations which the male nurse even brought up with me before the dr came in. Although it may be true that I do not need the drs services in the future cervical disc fusion I was hoping for some caring discussion about my continuing problem which generates from my cervical spine I left this very brief moment wont even call it an appointment with no help and no answers whatsoever as if my case is being dismissed from the neurosurgery category\n",
